    <h2>A tasty, nutrient packed meal sure to fill you up!</h2>
    <p>Today I'm going to be sharing one of my favorite recipes taught to me by my mother.
        It's a simple recipe at its core, and I'm sure the rest of you will enjoy it as well.
        I will be sharing a basic version of the dish, however I will include some suggestions for other ingredients and substitutions at the end    
    </p>
    <p>While the meal is best enjoyed warm, it can be stored in the fridge for a number of days to enjoy for some quick but hardy leftovers.  Additionally, sitting in the fridge will give it the time to congeal further and become nice and thick!</p>
